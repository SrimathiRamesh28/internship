A machine Learning intern worked in the field of data science. During the internship i have completed five projects on machine learning. The objective of machine learning is to train a model using historical,labelled data in order to predict the value of a quantity based on a new data for wich the target value or classification is unknown. I hereby attached my machine learning project along with the internship certificate.
